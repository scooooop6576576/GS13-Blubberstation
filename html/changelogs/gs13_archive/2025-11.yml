  EllaOW:
  - rscadd: Added the ability for plants and bees to produce lipoifier, micro-calorite,
      weak lipoifier, macernic and galbanic through their respective genome modification
      pathways.
  - rscadd: Added Adipolipus plants to codebase with a 20% lipo gene.
  - balance: disabled bluespace anomalies and prevented revenants from spawning based
      on corpse values.
  - bugfix: fixed nukies being able to spawn when antags are disabled.
  - config: supermatter surge now requires 10 people (was 0), energetic flux now requires
      5 people (was 1), pyroclastic anomaly now requires 8 people (was 1).
  - refactor: standardized code between config and examplestoryteller.dm files. config
      now has a set value of 60 for all event tracks, which is multiplied by the value
      in the storyteller files to create a rough equivalence of about 1 minute per
      1 value in the storyteller file.
  - config: major events now have a minimum of 10 players to run (down from 15) to
      allow for major events with slightly lower thresholds to still run. This does
      not affect events that had minimum populations greater than or equal to 15 already.
  - rscadd: New GS type narrator which cannot spawn antags
  - qol: made the GS narrator the default narrator and removed the ability for other
      narrators to be voted on (increased minpop to 60 which we never reach)
  - balance: Changed minimum popcount for events to spawn (most mega destructive events
      like mega meteor shower and directional sandstorm have at least 15/20+ or even
      higher pop requirement)
  - bugfix: fixed old storyteller config throwing errors during setup from outdated
      variables
  - code_imp: fixed incorrect code not correctly referencing event paths by having
      the code refer to the event name
  - code_imp: Added a unique GS narrator type define
  - config: decreased the popcount event time variables to account for smaller playerbase
      (result is that a lower pop doesn't result in a huge decrease of event amounts)
  Swan:
  - rscadd: ports over our posters, they can now be admin spawned or placed by an
      admin. Some might even spawn naturally?
  - rscadd: ports over large donut boxes and their crate
  - rscadd: galbanic addiction/overdose no longer removes nutrition, only increases
      hunger
  - bugfix: fixes dual tone cargo suit not being in the cargodrobe
  - bugfix: fixes the bluespace belt interface
  - image: gatoified donut boxes
  - image: slightly changes dual tone cargo suits color
  - map: adjusted atmos on box, making it more pleasant to work with
  - code_imp: adds an `adjust_hunger` proc to make setting fatness reduction for items
      easier
  - code_imp: moves the main dual tone jumpsuit defines to a new file to declutter
      the modular_items file
  - rscadd: makes it so my donator item doesn't just... burn into ash...
  - bugfix: fixes stuffed belly sprites disappearing when wearing the dual tone suit
  - bugfix: HOPEFULLY FIXES PERSISTENT WEIGHT THIS TIME GOD
  - bugfix: fixes calorite slimes not working when spawned in by admins
  - rscadd: control menu to the Bluespace belt, allowing the user to control the %
      of their fat they wish to hide/show. It can also be accessed by another player
      through the strip menu. It can also be accessed through alt click when you're
      wearing it.
  - rscadd: ports the metal cruncher trait, and makes calorite edible
  - rscadd: ports lipolicide tolerance
  - balance: lowers micro calorite metabolisation rate further
  - balance: drastically increases the amount of calorite found in the mines
  - bugfix: fixes some runtime related to calorite floors
  - bugfix: fixes a lot of our beaker presets being broken
  - bugfix: fixes a typo in the WG prefs screen
  - code_imp: adds 2 new procs for weight gain modifiers for clearing a single, or
      all sources
  - code_imp: moves the location of the mealdor resupply pack from `rebase_packs.dm`
      to `packs.dm`, and removes the old file since it was the only item in it.
  - rscadd: Yeen and protogen plushies, as well as re-adds the LGO and kota plushes
      to the loadout screen
  - rscadd: changed the way fullness_reduction works,
  - bugfix: fixes treadmills not being rotatable with a wrench, and disappearing when
      their panel was open
  - bugfix: fixes humogatitos missing their textures when opened and not having cigarettes
      inside. Also changes their sprite to the new one made by Clumpy
  - rscadd: Adds the CFC ai skin
  - rscadd: Adds 2 law boards with feeder laws, one antagonistic and other more neutral.
  - rscadd: Adds micro calorite reagent. It is obtained by grinding calorite alongside
      lipoifier, obtaining 0.5u per sheet of calorite grinded. Normally, it provides
      a +0.3 increase to weight gain rate and a -0.3 decrease to weight loss rate.
      It also decreases fullness and is very slow to metabolize. It has a 100u overdose,
      which adds BFI to the player (around 9 BFI per tick (3/5 of lipoifier)), as
      well as increases the WG/L rate modifier to 0.9.
  - rscadd: AL-T ray reverser now flips the value of weight loss rate on each hit.
      Getting hit once results in weight loss rate being set to negative, resulting
      in weight loss. Getting hit again reverses that effect, with any further hits
      repeating this process.
  - rscadd: due to a coding change that will be described later, calorite slimes maximum
      increase to weight gain and loss values has been lowered to 2
  - rscadd: munchies weed now reduce fullness without reducing nutrition, allowing
      for better simulation of hunger. this fullness system is currently pretty underbaked,
      but it should work for now as a suitable replacement until I come up with a
      better solution.
  - rscadd: changes the way modifying weight gain and loss rate through in-game means
      works. They will now be tracked separately from the value set in prefs, meaning
      that changing it won't override any modifiers a player may have obtained during
      the course of the round. They do not carry over between rounds.
  - bugfix: calorite can be printed from autolathes
  - bugfix: single side reflectors were applying the fattening effect meant for calorite
      reflectors. They no longer do it.
  - code_imp: adjusted the way weight gain/loss rate modifiers work. They are now
      tracked in a list containing key value pairs, with the key being the name of
      the source while the value being the additive change to be applied to the final
      WG/L rate. The values in the list are uncapped, however they are capped to a
      range of [-2, 2] when applying them for fatness adjustment calculations.
  - code_imp: added many procs to handle the WG/L rate modifier lists
  - code_imp: added a variable for flipping the sign on WG/L rate, one var for each.
  - code_imp: added procs to calculate the final WG/L rate applied to a mob, taking
      into consideration the value set in prefs, the flips and modifiers.
  - rscadd: ports fullness alert and fullness description text
  - rscadd: allows cargo to buy pipe scrubbers
  - rscadd: gulp cups
  - rscadd: civilian GATO dual tone suit
  - qol: prevents lipoifium from working at very low concetrations
  - bugfix: hopefully finally fixed persistent weight JESUS CHRIST
  - bugfix: apparently the sounds of chairs breaking from someone's fat ass were broken.
      This should fix it
  - rscadd: Primitive Bluespace Belt is now available in the loadout screen
  - code_imp: refactors helplessness mechanics - they are now based on a `/datum/helplessness`
      which stores the main logic, as well as many subtypes of it which store values
      and unique interactions. If something changed gameplay wise, report it for it
      is a bug.
  SeepingVisage:
  - bugfix: you can now print calovoltaic generator modules and hydraulic assistance
      modules
  - balance: the mod exoskeleton is cheaper
  - refactor: burp code
  - rscadd: belch
  - rscadd: fart
  - rscadd: playsound_prefed()
  - rscadd: preferences to enable/disable certain noises
