  Evilew:
  - map: 'updated the Lavaland Persistence Outpost: changed the Prisoner room a bit,
      adding new options for expansion content, and limiting the role to 2 slots (now
      with bigger rooms)'
  - rscadd: added a new note to the Syndicate Persistence Hostage, mentioning the
      newly added expansion content (basically a mention that the role isn't solely
      focused on expansion content, it caters to both and expansion stuff is optional)
  - map: 'added a new Virtual Domain for bitrunning: Calorite Temple. Easy difficulty,
      provides a few pieces of calorite upon completion (no further mechanics at the
      moment)'
  - map: cage 4 for Biodome will now feature chocolate slimes instead of cockroaches.
      Shoddy implementation but should be fine
  - map: 'various small tweaks to Meta, Box, Biodome and a few other maps: mostly
      adding stuff like missing consoles, public autolathes, broken turbine floors
      on Biodome broken airlocks or making something look better'
  - map: GATOified Biodome map, also improving some of the visuals, like the main
      Service area, dorms, corridors and whatnot
  - bugfix: GATOified Newscasters and console computer screens
  - map: GATOified Tramstation map
  - map: 'New expansion content area for the Ghost Cafe: Evil Feeder Basement'
  - map: Changed and expanded Calorite Temple area in Ghost Cafe
  - rscadd: added dual-tone jumpsuits for most of the roles into loadouts
  - bugfix: added directional calorite windows as a mapping prefab
  - map: added Xenoarch map. Currently not implemented yet, mostly added so it's there
      and can be worked on more easily
  OzzyMcPseudonym:
  - bugfix: Calorite Slimes no longer form invisible, deadly babies if you kill them
      when they're an adult.
  Sam:
  - rscadd: 'Added bursting mechanics: You can now enable bursting for your character
      by setting the Blueberry inflation bursting limit. This is the limit in units
      of blueberry juice that your character can take before popping. You will not
      burst immediately as you will get a pop-up that will asks for confirmation to
      burst now, or to delay the bursting. Delaying it will add a 5 minute timeout
      to bursting mechanics before it gets triggered again. NOTE: Nothing will happen
      until you press that burst now button, so you can use this time to finish an
      RP sentence, or emote your downfall. When you burst, all the juice within you
      gets splattered on the floor, possible knocking back bystanders.'
  - rscadd: 'Added preferences to be able to fall victim off, and to see bursting
      mechanics: There are 3 new preferences added. One is to enable bursting and
      setting your maximum capacity before you pop "Blueberry inflation bursting".
      Setting this to 0 will disable bursting and its mechanics. The second one is
      "Safe bursting" which will determine if your character dies (gets gibbed) after
      bursting, or if you''ll just lose all the juice (volume of blueberry juice inside
      of you set to 0). When you do not have Safe Bursting enabled, you will get an
      extra confirmation when you click burst that notifies you your character will
      die. The last option is "See bursting", which when disabled prevents people
      in your view to start the bursting process (including yourself). The about-to-be-burster
      will get a notification that someone with the pref disabled is nearby, so they
      know that they need to move location (or scare you away).'
  - rscadd: 'Added flavour for blueberry inflation: When your character''s got juice
      in them, they''ll start exhibiting more symptoms depending on how close to their
      bursting point they are. From flavour text, to sounds, to dripping streaks of
      blueberry, and finally leaking actual juice that forms puddles on the ground.
      NOTE: At this time, viruses are transmissible via streaks (the decals) and getting
      hit by gibs when someone else bursts and dies. The puddles of blueberry juice
      do, as of now, not infect you with viruses.'
  Swan:
  - rscadd: Adds the caloray. It is a weapon which can either discharge a cell to
      fatten someone up, or thin someone down while charging a powercell. It uses
      a continous beam which latches onto the target. It is available from the nutri-tech
      weapons research node. Sprites were made by Clumpy.
  - balance: lowers the material cost of fatorays and al-T rays 10x - because using
      13 calorite sheets for a gun is a bit much.
  - rscadd: added breast feeding mechanics. Players will now be allowed to drink milk
      directly from their own, or another player's breasts, as well as feed other
      players, providing some conditions are met (prefs, tits, lactation from them
      etc)
  - rscadd: breasts now produce milk directly after spawning in, not just after being
      stimulated
  - rscadd: you can now choose the reagents your breasts will produce from a list
      of approved reagents
  - rscadd: alien honey, which has the stats of regular honey, but doesn't heal nor
      add sugar (so no sugar overdose)
  - code_imp: adds a new interaction usage, for interactions only meant to work on
      the player performing them
  - qol: addict traits (smoker, junkie, alcoholic) should be a lot less painful, while
      also activating it's effects less often
  - qol: the oversized trait no longer causes the player to be unable to be closed
      in machines
  - qol: the oversized trait no longer makes the player break any chair they sit on
      - that behavior is now reserved for the real fat asses
  - qol: small/micro quirks no longer make you trip when passing any other mob
  - balance: High metabolization of nitrium no longer scales it's toxin damage with
      time
  - bugfix: fixes HFRs damage from too high moles no longer scales quadratically with
      time
  - bugfix: fixes micro calorite not clearing it's effects at very low concentrations
  - bugfix: fixes a piece of addiction code I broke some time ago. Whoops.
  - rscadd: added the thick neck pref and quirk, which will prevent you from wearing
      items around your neck slot
  - rscadd: added the reduced FOV helplessness pref - reduces the player's FOV to
      180 degrees in front at the weight set in the pref, and to 90 degrees in the
      front when exceeding double the set value.
  - rscdel: nearsightedness helplessness pref was removed
  - bugfix: fixes perma fat not properly scaling with WG/L rate modifiers
  - code_imp: '`adjust_perma` and `adjust_fatness` procs now return the amount of
      fat they applied onto their targets'
  - rscadd: ports the adipoelectric generator - this machine turns fat into electrical
      power
  - rscadd: ports the adipoelectric transformer - this machine turns electricity into
      fat
  - balance: allows for the primitive BS belt to be craftable at round start, provided
      silver is available
  - balance: increases the power draw of the primitive BS belt
  - bugfix: fixes beanbags not being craftable
  - rscadd: GS13 changelogs will now display in game
  - code_imp: updated code for automatic changelog generation to tag our PR files
      with a `gs13` tag
  - code_imp: updated code for changelog compilation to compile our changelogs, and
      only those with the `gs13` tag
  Swan and Reny:
  - rscadd: adds the hotbar. It combines the functionalities of the plant and food
      smartfridge. Credit to Reny for the sprites.
  smerglemzerb:
  - bugfix: Fixes player muscle examines showing up with player fat examines
