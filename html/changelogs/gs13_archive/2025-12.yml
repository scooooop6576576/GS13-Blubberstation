  - rscadd: adds micro calorite poisoning. It is a persistent debuff applied onto
      the character upon consuming the micro calorite reagent. It has various effects
      based on it's value, in a range from 0 to 100. It's effects include increasing
      weight gain and decreasing weight loss rate, random stomach gurgles, increasing
      hunger, removal of the fat aversion trait, mood debuffs when a character is
      below a certain fullness level, addition of the fat affinity trait, a movespeed
      debuff, and passive gaining of real and perma fat. It's value increases and
      decreases very slowly, likely requiring multiple rounds to take full effect.
      Current gain rate is 10 points per hour, assuming micro calorite is inside a
      character for the entire hour.
