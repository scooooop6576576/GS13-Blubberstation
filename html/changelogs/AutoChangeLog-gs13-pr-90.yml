changes:
  - rscadd: "Added bursting mechanics: You can now enable bursting for your character by setting the Blueberry inflation bursting limit. This is the limit in units of blueberry juice that your character can take before popping. You will not burst immediately as you will get a pop-up that will asks for confirmation to burst now, or to delay the bursting. Delaying it will add a 5 minute timeout to bursting mechanics before it gets triggered again. NOTE: Nothing will happen until you press that burst now button, so you can use this time to finish an RP sentence, or emote your downfall. When you burst, all the juice within you gets splattered on the floor, possible knocking back bystanders."
  - rscadd: "Added preferences to be able to fall victim off, and to see bursting mechanics: There are 3 new preferences added. One is to enable bursting and setting your maximum capacity before you pop \"Blueberry inflation bursting\". Setting this to 0 will disable bursting and its mechanics. The second one is \"Safe bursting\" which will determine if your character dies (gets gibbed) after bursting, or if you'll just lose all the juice (volume of blueberry juice inside of you set to 0). When you do not have Safe Bursting enabled, you will get an extra confirmation when you click burst that notifies you your character will die. The last option is \"See bursting\", which when disabled prevents people in your view to start the bursting process (including yourself). The about-to-be-burster will get a notification that someone with the pref disabled is nearby, so they know that they need to move location (or scare you away)."
  - rscadd: "Added flavour for blueberry inflation: When your character's got juice in them, they'll start exhibiting more symptoms depending on how close to their bursting point they are. From flavour text, to sounds, to dripping streaks of blueberry, and finally leaking actual juice that forms puddles on the ground. NOTE: At this time, viruses are transmissible via streaks (the decals) and getting hit by gibs when someone else bursts and dies. The puddles of blueberry juice do, as of now, not infect you with viruses."
